## Capstone Project: Stock Market Data Analysis - Bohubrihi


This repository contains a capstone project on stock market data analysis. It reflects what I learned on the Bohubrihi platform, combining the knowledge and skills gained from various assignments and activities that explored data from the Bangladesh stock market.



### Analysis Tools:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** All analyses are conducted in Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive and user-friendly environment.

- **Pandas Library:** Leveraging the Pandas library for straightforward and efficient manipulation and analysis of stock market data.



### Project Highlights:

Explore the fascinating world of stock market data with a focus on simplicity and clarity. Key highlights include:

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** Calculate essential statistics, explore 'Close' price distributions, and identify outliers in the dataset.

- **Time Series Analysis:** Visualize 'Close' prices over time, calculate daily percentage changes, and apply moving averages for trend analysis.

- **Volatility Analysis:** Plot rolling standard deviations, analyze daily price changes, and identify significant price movements.

- **Correlation and Heatmaps:** Explore the relationship between trading volume and volatility, calculate correlation matrices, and create easy-to-read heatmaps using the seaborn package.
